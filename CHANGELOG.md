## `v1.0.1` 17th August 2025 [RELEASE]
### Changed
- The way settings are used has been rebuild. `ConLogSet(true, true, true, true, true)` becomes `ConLogSet({error: true, ok: true, warning: true, object: true, color: true})`. This way you can now target a setting, without needing to set them all `ConLogSet({error: false})`.

- Syntax highlighter for type 4 | objects when color enabled.
- Error/warning origin and line notifier.
